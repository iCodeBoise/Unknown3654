    <p> I'm back! So my species is called icio dragofisa. We stop aging at 1000 years. Whenever one of us dies, another on spawns. There are always 3000 ice dragons in the world, no matter what. The ice dragon king recently died, and my son was born. We have impenetrable scales that can change color based on it's habitat. I can also shapeshift into a rock if I need to. We can shoot ice and water. In the world, there are thousands and thousands of dragons. Ice dragons, earth dragons, wind dragons, and fire dragons. We are peaceful with the wind and earth dragons. We meet a lot, and we also trade lots of minerals and powers. But the fire dragons are evil. They started a war with all the other dragons, and they almost terminated the earth dragons with their flames. But we defeated them and got justice. Hundreds of years ago, dragons and humans were the best of friends. Each human had a dragon and rode them around. My great-great grandfather's human friend is the one you see in the picture below.  </p>
