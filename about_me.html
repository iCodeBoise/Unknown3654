      <p> As I said before, I am the queen of ice dragons. I have an army of 3000 dragons. A few days ago, a human spotted me scavenging for food. The humans that spotted me were big men with weird sharp things in their hands. I tried to freeze him up, but he escaped. I looked him up, and I figured out that his name is Nik Schellburger. Nik is a German spy. He is wanted in the world of dragons. Everybody knows about Nik trying to attack me, and it's only been a day. Some of my favorite foods are humans, angler fish and sharks. While in flight, I attack any helicopters, planes, and rockets. They take up too much room in the sky, and leave no space for us. </p>
